samething is a [Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_Area_Message_Encoding)
header tone generator.

**WARNING**: Neither the author, nor the contributors to this project are
responsible for the misuse of this software. The tones generated by this
software have the potential to activate EAS decoder systems in the continental
United States of America and its territories, along with various offshore marine
areas, if transmitted.

Do **not** transmit these tones over any radio communications unless so duly
authorized.

Do **not** play these tones in public areas.

If you do not heed the above warnings, [see what the FCC may do to you](https://www.fcc.gov/tags/emergency-alert-system-rules-eas),
not counting possible criminal penalties if the intent was malicious. This was
written for an educational purpose; not a malicious one.

## Introduction

samething allows a user to generate Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) header
tones.

A native user interface is provided for Windows, macOS, and Linux users to
provide a simple and easy method of generation. It also serves to demonstrate
how to integrate the core into a frontend.

The core does not make use of dynamic memory allocation, recursion, dynamic
dispatch, RTTI, exceptions, or the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). These
choices were made for efficiency reasons and to facilitate ports to resource
constrained systems.

## Building

samething makes use of specialized toolchains which are suitable for development
and deployment. For more information, navigate to the `toolchains` folder and
select your host system for instructions. Not using the provided toolchain is
entirely unsupported, and I wish you the best of luck if you're going that
route.
